# puretargetR
puretargetR is a lightweight, R toolkit that transforms CSV outputs from TRGT into summaries of repeat composition across all loci and samples. It parses allele-specific motif counts and identifies dominant repeat motifsâ€”without re-alignment or BAM access, enabling quick visualization of repeat motif diversity at the cohort-level.
